Microservices Infrastructure provides a platform for running
microservices (or whatever else you'd like) on top of `Apache Mesos`_
and `Marathon`_. It also provides service discovery via `Consul`_, and
supports containerization (with `Docker`_) out of the box.

.. _Marathon: https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/
.. _Consul: https://consul.io/
.. _Docker: https://www.docker.com/
