Overview
--------
Microservices infrastructure is a powerful platform for rapidly deploying containers any analytic applications.

##Features

* Docker Container support
* Mesos, Marathon and Zookeeper
* Consul DNS-based service discovery 
* High Availability
* Multi-Datacenter support
* Vagrantfile for testing

####Architecture
The base platform contains control nodes that manage the cluster and any number of compute nodes. Containers automatically register themselves into DNS so that other services can locate them.

Once WAN joining is configured, each cluster find services in other data centers via DNS or the [Consul API](http://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html). 

![Mult-DC](docs/_static/multi_dc.png =480x)

####Control Nodes

The compute node manages a single datacenter.  Each control node runs Consul for service discovery, Mesos leaders for resource scheduling and Mesos frameworks like Marathon. 

In general, it's best to provision 3 or 5 control nodes to achieve higher availability of services.

####Compute Nodes

The compute node launches containers and other Mesos-based workloads. Registrator is used to update Consul as containers are launched and exit.
